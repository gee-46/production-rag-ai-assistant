# 🧠 Production-Grade RAG AI System

> Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch — focusing on **system design, control, reliability, and retrieval quality**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **modular RAG pipeline** that enhances LLM responses using **external knowledge retrieval**.

Instead of relying purely on pretrained knowledge, the system:

- Retrieves relevant information from a document store
- Grounds responses using retrieved context
- Controls LLM output to reduce hallucination
- Exposes the pipeline through a FastAPI backend
- Supports dynamic document uploads without restarting the server
- Persists vector embeddings across server restarts
- Uses cross-encoder reranking for improved retrieval quality

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an **industry-relevant AI system** that demonstrates:

- End-to-end RAG architecture  
- Clear separation of retrieval vs generation  
- Controlled LLM behavior through prompt engineering  
- Local + pluggable LLM backend  
- API-based AI system deployment  
- Dynamic knowledge ingestion pipelines  
- Persistent vector database architecture  
- Advanced retrieval engineering techniques

## 🔥 Key Features

### ✅ Semantic Retrieval

- Converts text into dense vector embeddings
- Enables meaning-based search instead of keyword matching

---

### ✅ FAISS Vector Search

- Efficient similarity search
- Retrieves top-k relevant chunks

---

### ✅ Document Chunking

- Overlapping chunk strategy
- Preserves context across splits
- Improves retrieval accuracy

---

### ✅ Context Engineering

- Structured prompt design
- Forces model to answer only from retrieved context
- Reduces hallucination

---

### ✅ Structured Output Control

- Enforces bullet-point responses
- Removes unnecessary verbosity
- Produces concise and readable outputs

---

### ✅ Local LLM Integration

- Uses Ollama (LLaMA 3)
- No API dependency
- Fully offline inference capability

---

### ✅ FastAPI Backend Integration

- Exposes RAG pipeline through REST API
- Supports query-based interaction using `/query`
- Auto-generated Swagger documentation (`/docs`)
- Returns structured JSON responses

---

### ✅ Dynamic Document Upload (Day 8)

- Upload `.txt` and `.docx` files dynamically
- Automatically chunks uploaded content
- Generates embeddings in real-time
- Updates FAISS vector store live
- Makes uploaded knowledge immediately searchable

---

### ✅ Persistent Vector Storage (Day 9)

- Saves FAISS vector index locally
- Restores embeddings automatically on server restart
- Preserves uploaded knowledge across sessions
- Enables stateful retrieval architecture

---

### ✅ Cross-Encoder Reranking (Day 10)

- Implements two-stage retrieval architecture
- Uses semantic reranking after FAISS retrieval
- Improves chunk relevance and answer grounding
- Reduces noisy retrieval results
- Uses `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`

---

## 🔍 Example Workflow

```python
Query: "What are advantages of RAG?"

→ Embed query
→ Retrieve candidate chunks
→ Rerank retrieved chunks
→ Build structured prompt
→ Generate grounded answer
→ Return API response
```
